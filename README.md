#   :birth_date => Birth date (eg. 'yyyy-mm-dd').
#   :gender => Gender (eg. 'famale').
```
Validations
```ruby
CivilNumber::Validator.new({number:'Some number', country_code:'nl'}).valid? # => true

CivilNumber::Validator.new({number:'Some number', country_code:'nl', birth_date: 'yyyy-mm-dd'}).valid? # => true

CivilNumber::Validator.new({number:'Some number', country_code:'nl'}) # => #<CivilNumber::Validator:0x000000021e2420 @civil_number="Some number", @country_code="NL", @birth_date=birth_date from civil number information, @gender=gender from civil number information>

civil_number = CivilNumber::Validator.new({number:'Some number', country_code:'nl'})
civil_number.valid? # => false
civil_number.error # => "birth date 1933-09-25 dont match 1933-09-24"
```
